Notable product changes for Chronote users. For the full changelog, see the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Chronote-gg/Chronote/releases).

## 2026

### Installation source reporting

- Add to Discord links on the Chronote website now preserve a limited acquisition source through Discord authorization, so we can understand which public pages and referrals lead to a real server installation.
- The record contains source, medium, campaign, a coarse landing-page category, an approved referring-domain category, and button location. It does not contain the full referring URL or query, a browser or session identifier, or a share-link id.
- Adding Chronote does not sign you into the portal or request your email or server list. A later installation can record its new installer and source. Chronote attempts to clear the installer record when it observes the bot being removed. If that event is missed while Chronote is offline, the old record can remain until a later installation replaces it; it no longer grants installer access after the bot rejoins.
- Do Not Track disables this attribution as well as our other website analytics. Installs started directly in Discord or another directory remain unattributed.

### Teach Chronote in natural language

- Members with **Manage Server** can describe names, acronyms, and specialized vocabulary in Server Settings instead of formatting each term first.
- Chronote uses AI to propose exact spellings and concise descriptions, but each entry remains an editable draft until the member reviews the batch and approves it.
- After applying a notes correction in the web portal, a member with **Manage Server** can optionally review proposals based on a short-lived excerpt limited to 2,000 characters of the notes diff and 2,000 characters from matching transcript segments. Applying the correction itself never teaches the dictionary.
- PostHog usage analytics contain counts and categories, never the instruction, terms, notes, or transcript content. Separate engineering traces can include content as described in the updated [privacy policy](/legal/privacy).

### Server controls for transcript and recording access

- Server admins with **Manage Server** can independently block new transcript and audio recording access while keeping meeting summaries and notes visible.
- The controls apply to existing and future server meetings, including transcript sharing, live transcript access, portal exports, and Remote MCP.
- These settings control access only. Chronote still records, transcribes, summarizes, and stores meeting artifacts unless the meeting is deleted.

### Chronote Desktop is open to every account

- Chronote Desktop no longer requires desktop access to be enabled on your account. Any Chronote account can sign in and upload a recording.
- Desktop sign-in now asks you to approve the connection in your browser and lists what the app will be able to do. Approve it only when you started the sign-in yourself.
- It remains a Windows-only beta, and beta builds may be unsigned.

### Analytics now cover what you do in Discord

- Product analytics now record actions taken through Chronote in Discord, not only on the website and web portal. They capture that an action happened and its shape, never its content.
- While you are signed in, analytics are tied to your Discord account rather than an anonymous browser identifier. Signing out unlinks the browser again.
- IP addresses are discarded on arrival, so we no longer derive an approximate location from them.
- Do Not Track still covers the website and portal, but cannot cover Discord, because the bot never sees your browser. Email us to opt out of that side.
- See [Analytics now cover what you do in Discord](/whats-new/analytics-in-discord) and the updated [privacy policy](/legal/privacy).

### Role mentions in meeting notes

- Notes now mention server roles when work is assigned to a group rather than to one person.
- Member and role mentions can appear anywhere in the notes.
- Role mentions resolve to readable role names in the web portal, shared links, Notion exports, and Markdown exports.
- Mentions in notes stay display-only, so posting notes still does not ping anyone.

### Personal media uploads

- Upload existing audio or video files from the web portal to create personal Chronote meetings.
- Uploaded media is transcribed, summarized, and saved in My Meetings under your personal workspace.
- Optional titles and tags can be added before processing starts.
- Personal Notion automation can export uploaded and personal meetings to your Notion destination after processing completes.
- Personal Notion automation is managed from Personal Settings, keeping My Meetings focused on finding and opening meetings.
- The web portal sidebar now separates Personal flows from Server flows so account-owned meetings, uploads, and integrations are visually distinct from server Library, Ask, Billing, and Server Settings.

### Remote MCP live controls

- AI assistants can now start Chronote recordings from your current Discord voice channel through Remote MCP.
- Remote MCP can stop active meetings, check live meeting status, and fetch available live transcript events using existing meeting/transcript scopes plus separate start/stop OAuth consent scopes.
- Meeting control requests are queued so Chronote can route work to the bot runtime that owns the live recording.

### Transcription reliability guardrails

- Low-confidence transcription retries now reject punctuation-only outputs before they can replace a real transcript.
- Finalized meeting audio gets an extra verification pass to clean up repeated short hallucinations before notes are generated.

### Public documentation launch

- Product documentation is now available at [docs.chronote.gg](https://docs.chronote.gg).
- Docs cover getting started, features, admin setup, and troubleshooting.
- Documentation updates ship alongside product changes.

### Meeting sharing

- Share meeting notes via a public link from the web portal.
- Recipients can view the meeting summary, notes, and transcript without joining your server.

### Notes correction flow

- Suggest corrections to meeting notes directly from Discord or the web portal.
- Corrections use the original transcript as ground truth, so the AI cannot add content that was not discussed.
- Versioned notes track every edit with author attribution.

### Text-to-speech

- Use `/tts enable` to have your chat messages spoken aloud in the meeting voice channel.
- Choose from multiple voice options with `/tts voice`.
- Set your spoken name, speaker prefix mode, and volume from `/tts`.
- Use `/say` for one-off messages without enabling ongoing TTS.
- Enable TTS-only channel startup so Chronote can speak chat messages without recording, transcription, notes, chat logs, or meeting artifacts.
- TTS-only sessions now clean themselves up after inactivity, and servers may see a monthly chat-to-speech cap notice when plan limits are reached.
- Use `/leave` to make Chronote leave a TTS-only session immediately, or require explicit confirmation before ending a recorded meeting.

### Ask past meetings

- Use `/ask` to query your meeting history with natural-language questions.
- Answers include citations linking to specific meetings.
- Filter by tags or scope to a single channel.
