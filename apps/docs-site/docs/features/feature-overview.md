This page is a reference for every Chronote command and feature. Each section describes what the feature does, how to use it, and what to expect.

## Server plans

Basic is the recommended starting point when upgrading a Free server. You can
still select Pro directly. Compare plans in your server's Billing page or on the
[upgrade page](https://chronote.gg/upgrade).

| Limit                             | Free       | Basic    | Pro             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Recording time per rolling 7 days | 4 hours    | 20 hours | No weekly limit |
| Maximum meeting length            | 90 minutes | 2 hours  | 2 hours         |
| Meetings included in Ask scope    | Up to 5    | Up to 25 | Up to 100       |

Ask scope is the number of meetings available to a question, not a storage
retention period. Pro's lack of a weekly recording limit does not remove the
two-hour limit on each meeting. Review available billing changes before
confirming payment.

## Slash commands

### `/startmeeting`

Starts a recorded meeting in the voice channel you are currently in. You can also right-click yourself, Chronote, or someone in your voice channel and select **Apps** -> **Start meeting** to start without context or tags.

| Option    | Required | Description                                |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `context` | No       | Describe the meeting topic (max 500 chars) |
| `tags`    | No       | Comma-separated tags (max 500 chars)       |

**Requirements**: You must be in a voice channel. The bot needs Connect and Speak permissions in that voice channel, and View Channel, Send Messages, and Read Message History in the text channel. No other meeting can be active in the server.

**Output**: A "Meeting Started" embed with End Meeting and Edit Tags buttons, plus a Live transcript button when the Chronote portal is configured and the server allows transcript access.

### `/autorecord`

Configures automatic recording for voice channels. Requires **Manage Channels** permission.

| Subcommand    | Options                                 | Description                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `enable`      | `voice-channel`, `text-channel`, `tags` | Auto-record a specific voice channel   |
| `disable`     | `voice-channel`                         | Stop auto-recording a specific channel |
| `enable-all`  | `text-channel`, `tags`                  | Auto-record every voice channel        |
| `disable-all` | (none)                                  | Turn off server-wide auto-recording    |
| `list`        | (none)                                  | Show all auto-record rules             |

When auto-record is enabled, Chronote starts recording automatically whenever someone joins the configured voice channel. Notes are posted to the specified text channel.

After a meeting is explicitly ended, auto-record is suppressed for that channel until it fully empties, preventing an immediate re-recording loop.

### `/context`

Manages context that is injected into transcription and notes prompts. Requires **Manage Channels** permission.

| Subcommand      | Options                    | Description                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `set-server`    | `context` (max 2000 chars) | Set server-wide context                  |
| `set-channel`   | `channel`, `context`       | Set context for a specific voice channel |
| `view`          | `channel` (optional)       | View current context settings            |
| `clear-server`  | (none)                     | Remove server-wide context               |
| `clear-channel` | `channel`                  | Remove context for a channel             |
| `list`          | (none)                     | List all context settings                |

Context helps the AI understand your domain. For example, setting server context to "Backend engineering team at Acme Corp working on the Rocket API" tells the model what kind of conversations to expect.

Context stacks: server context applies to all meetings, channel context applies to meetings in that channel, and meeting context (from `/startmeeting`) applies to that specific meeting.

### `/dictionary`

Manages a glossary of terms that are injected into prompts. Requires **Manage Channels** permission.

| Subcommand | Options                                                       | Description                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `add`      | `term` (max 80 chars), `definition` (optional, max 400 chars) | Add or update a term            |
| `remove`   | `term`                                                        | Remove a term                   |
| `list`     | (none)                                                        | List all terms (up to 20 shown) |
| `clear`    | (none)                                                        | Remove all terms                |

All responses are ephemeral (visible only to you).

Dictionary terms are injected into the transcription prompt to help the AI spell them correctly. Definitions are included in the notes prompt (but not the transcription prompt) to give the AI additional context without bloating the transcription input.

Members with **Manage Server** can also open **Server Settings** -> **Teach Chronote** and describe the vocabulary in ordinary language. Chronote creates temporary proposed entries and short descriptions, but no entry is added to the server dictionary until the member reviews the batch and approves that entry. Possible conflicts and proposals without an exact spelling start unchecked.

After a member with **Manage Server** applies a notes correction in the web portal, Chronote offers an optional **Teach Chronote from this correction** step. Clicking **Review terms** sends the member's instruction, up to 2,000 characters of the notes diff, and up to 2,000 characters from lexically matching transcript segments to OpenAI. Applying the notes correction alone never changes the dictionary.

**Examples of useful dictionary entries:**

- `Kubernetes` (no definition needed, just ensures correct spelling)
- `LGTM` with definition `Looks Good To Me, a code review approval`
- `Jane Smith` with definition `Engineering manager, backend team`

### `/ask`

Ask natural-language questions about past meetings.

| Option     | Required | Description                                                |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `question` | Yes      | Your question                                              |
| `tags`     | No       | Filter by tags                                             |
| `scope`    | No       | "Guild" (default, searches all channels) or "Channel only" |

Chronote searches your meeting history and generates an answer with citations linking to specific meetings. The number of meetings searched depends on your plan tier.

### `/tts`

Controls text-to-speech for chat messages and TTS-only voice sessions.

| Subcommand        | Options                               | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `enable`          | (none)                                | Your chat messages are spoken aloud              |
| `disable`         | (none)                                | Stop speaking your messages                      |
| `voice`           | `voice` (pick from list or "default") | Choose a TTS voice                               |
| `prefix`          | `mode`                                | Choose when your spoken name prefixes TTS output |
| `nickname`        | `name`                                | Set a spoken TTS name                            |
| `clear-nickname`  | (none)                                | Reset your spoken TTS name                       |
| `volume`          | `percent`                             | Set your personal TTS playback volume            |
| `enable-channel`  | `voice-channel`, `text-channel`       | Enable automatic TTS-only startup for a channel  |
| `disable-channel` | `voice-channel`                       | Disable automatic chat-to-speech for a channel   |
| `stop`            | (none)                                | Stop current playback or a TTS-only session      |

When enabled during a recorded meeting, any message you send in the meeting text channel is spoken aloud in the voice channel. TTS that plays during a recorded meeting is included in the meeting recording and transcript.

When TTS-only startup is enabled, Chronote can join a voice channel to speak chat messages without starting a recorded meeting. TTS-only sessions do not record audio, transcribe speech, save chat logs, generate notes, or create meeting artifacts. They end automatically when the voice channel empties or after a period without spoken TTS activity.

Chronote may enforce a monthly chat-to-speech message cap for your server's plan. When the cap is reached, `/say` and automatic chat-to-speech stop accepting new messages and show an upgrade prompt.

### `/whois`

Shows a user's Discord name and spoken TTS settings, including spoken name, voice, prefix mode, volume, and chat TTS opt-out state. The response is visible only to you.

### `/say`

Speak a single message aloud in the meeting voice channel.

| Option    | Required | Description       |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| `message` | Yes      | The text to speak |

Unlike `/tts enable`, this is a one-shot command. If no recorded meeting is active and TTS-only startup is enabled for the channel, `/say` starts a privacy-safe TTS-only session automatically. The same monthly chat-to-speech cap applies to `/say` messages.

### `/leave`

Disconnects Chronote from the active voice channel.

For TTS-only sessions, `/leave` makes Chronote leave immediately after the normal permission check. For recorded meetings, `/leave confirm:true` is required because leaving ends the recording and starts normal meeting processing.

### `/billing`

Manage your server's Chronote subscription. Opens the Stripe billing portal for plan management.

### `/onboard`

Launches a guided setup wizard for new servers. Requires **Manage Server** permission. Walks through selecting a notes channel and setting context. Dictionary terms can be taught afterward in Server Settings or managed with `/dictionary`.

Can be disabled server-wide after initial setup.

## Button interactions

These buttons appear on meeting embeds:

| Button             | When it appears       | What it does                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

| Generate Image     | After meeting ends    | Creates a DALL-E image from the meeting (plan-gated) |

## Mentions in notes

Chronote writes notes that refer to people and groups using Discord mentions, so an assignment reads as the actual person or team rather than a guessed name.

- Individual assignments use a member mention, for example when one person owns a follow-up.
- Group assignments use a role mention, for example when the transcript says all moderators or the whole design team should do something.
- Chronote only mentions members who attended and roles that exist in your server, and it never produces an `@everyone` or `@here` mention. Mentions in generated notes are checked against those lists before the notes are saved, so a mention is never a guess.

Mentions inside meeting notes are display-only. Discord does not send notifications for mentions in an embed, so nobody is pinged when notes are posted.

In the web portal, shared links, Notion exports, and Markdown exports, mentions are shown as readable names instead of raw ids.

## Notes correction flow

1. Click **Suggest correction** on a meeting summary.
2. A modal appears with a text field. Describe what should change (up to 1500 characters). For example: "The decision was to use PostgreSQL, not MySQL" or "Add the action item for Jake to update the API docs."
3. Chronote reads the saved transcript and current notes, then generates a minimal correction. A line diff is shown.
4. An authorized reviewer clicks **Accept & update** or **Reject**.

**Who can approve**: The meeting creator for manual meetings. Anyone with Manage Channels for auto-recorded meetings.

Accepted corrections:

- Replace the notes embeds with updated content.
- Increment the notes version (shown in the footer as "v2", "v3", etc.).
- Record the editor and suggestion in the history.
- In the web portal, offer an optional dictionary-teaching step to server admins. It is never automatic, and every proposed term still requires approval.

Each correction is instructed to use the transcript as ground truth and keep edits minimal. Review the proposed diff before applying it; model output is not treated as guaranteed fact.

If a server has disabled transcript access, Chronote's automated correction workflow still uses the stored transcript for this check. It does not return the transcript as an artifact, but the proposed notes change and diff can include details or wording from the transcript.

Corrections can also assign work to a member or a role. Asking for something like "assign this to the moderators" produces a role mention, the same way generated notes do. Existing mentions in the notes are preserved, and a correction can only mention members who attended and roles that exist in your server, so it cannot invent one.

## Server artifact access

Server admins with **Manage Server** can independently disable viewer access to meeting transcripts and audio recordings from **Server Settings** -> **Meetings**. The controls apply to past and future server meetings, including shared pages and Remote MCP transcript retrieval. Summaries and notes remain available.

These are access controls, not recording or deletion controls. Chronote still records and transcribes meetings, generates summaries, stores the artifacts, and can make them available again if a server admin re-enables access. Disabling access blocks future retrieval through Chronote, but cannot recall downloaded copies. An issued audio URL remains usable for up to 15 minutes, and an already-open live transcript stream stays connected until the meeting ends or the viewer disconnects. Personal meetings and uploads remain controlled by their owner.

## Importing external notes

If you took notes in another app, open the meeting in the web portal and choose **Import notes** from the notes actions menu.

Imported notes can:

- Replace the current Chronote notes.
- Append under an **Imported notes** section.
- Include an optional source name and URL for traceability.

Imports are saved as a new notes version and update the posted Discord notes when possible.

## Exporting notes to Notion

Open a meeting in the web portal and choose **Export to Notion** from the notes actions menu. If Notion is not connected yet, Chronote starts the Notion authorization flow first.

After export, Chronote stores the Notion page link on that meeting for your user account. If Chronote notes are edited later, choose **Sync latest to Notion** to replace the Notion page content with the newest Chronote notes version.

Server managers can configure automatic Notion export from **Server Settings** -> **Notion integration**. Choose a shared destination page, turn on automatic export, and optionally limit exports to selected voice channels or tags. Meeting viewers can open the automated Notion page from the meeting detail when they have access to the Chronote meeting.

You can also configure personal Notion automation from **Personal Settings**. Personal automation exports personal uploads and other personal meetings to your Notion destination. Shared viewers can export their own manual copy, but only the personal meeting owner can manage or retry owner automation.

If automated export fails because Notion access was revoked or the destination is unavailable, Chronote keeps the automation setting and shows the latest error in Personal Settings, Server Settings, and the Library. A server manager can reconnect Notion, choose a new destination, or retry the export from the meeting actions.

Chronote remains the source of truth. Notion export and sync are one-way from Chronote to Notion.

## Meeting image generation

After a meeting ends, click **Generate Image** to create a DALL-E-generated visual summary. The image is based on the meeting transcript and context.

This feature requires a Basic plan or higher.

## Web portal

The Chronote web portal provides a browser-based interface for:

- Browsing meeting history with search and filters.
- Viewing **My Meetings** as your portal home, with All time results, a **Load more** control for older meetings, and direct links to meetings across servers you can access.
- Uploading personal audio or video files for transcription and notes.
- Configuring personal Notion automation from **Personal Settings** for uploaded and personal meetings.
- Reading full transcripts and notes.
- Sharing meeting links with teammates.
- Suggesting and applying notes corrections.
- Importing Markdown or plain-text notes from another app.
- Managing server settings (context, dictionary, auto-record, Notion automation).

Access the portal from the **Open in Chronote** button on any meeting summary, or open the portal directly to start from **My Meetings**. The sidebar separates **Personal** flows from **Server** flows: use **My Meetings**, **Upload Media**, and **Personal Settings** for account-owned work, then choose a server in the **Server** section before opening Library, Ask, Billing, or Server Settings. Use **Support** in the portal sidebar to email Chronote support.

## Personal media uploads

Use **Upload Media** in the web portal to turn an existing audio or video file into a personal Chronote meeting.

1. Open the portal and choose **Upload Media** from the sidebar, or **Upload media** from **My Meetings**.
2. Choose an audio or video file.
3. Optionally add a title and comma-separated tags.
4. Click **Upload and process**.
5. Keep the page open until the upload finishes. Chronote will continue processing after the file is received.

When processing completes, the meeting appears in **My Meetings** under your personal workspace. Uploaded personal meetings are owned by your Chronote account, not by a Discord server.

## Chronote Desktop recordings

Chronote Desktop records a personal meeting directly from a Windows computer. It captures your microphone as **Me**, captures system audio as **System/Other**, saves sealed local audio segments while recording, uploads those segments to Chronote, and creates a personal meeting in **My Meetings**.

Chronote Desktop is a Windows-only beta. Any Chronote account can sign in and upload; no special access is needed.

1. Open Chronote Desktop.
2. Sign in with Chronote. The app opens your browser, which asks you to confirm the connection and lists what the app will be able to do. Approve it and the browser returns you to the desktop app. Chronote cannot tell which program on your computer opened that page, so only approve it if you just started the sign-in yourself.
3. Choose a microphone and system output device, or keep the defaults.
4. Click **Start recording**.
5. Click **Stop and upload** when the meeting ends.

Desktop recordings use your Chronote account and do not require a Discord voice channel. Keep the app open until the upload is received. Processing continues in Chronote after the upload completes. If upload fails, or if the app closes after one or more segments were sealed, Chronote Desktop keeps the local recording available in **Saved recordings** so you can retry the upload, open the local folder, or delete it when you no longer need it. Use **Open Chronote** in the desktop app to open **My Meetings** in the web portal.

## Context menu commands

Right-click a user in the voice channel to access:

- **Stop recording**: Ends the current meeting. For short auto-recorded meetings, this can cancel the recording instead of generating notes.
